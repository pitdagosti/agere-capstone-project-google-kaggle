# CRITICAL UPDATE: README Purpose Correction

**Date:** November 24, 2025  
**Updated by:** Team Clarification  
**Urgency:** HIGH - Fundamental perspective shift

---

## 🚨 The Issue

The initial README update positioned AGERE as a **recruiter tool** for screening candidates. 

**THIS WAS INCORRECT.**

## ✅ The Correct Purpose

AGERE is a **candidate empowerment tool** - an AI career coach that helps job seekers:

1. **Validate their readiness** for specific job opportunities
2. **Test their skills** through objective assessments
3. **Connect with the right people** at target companies
4. **Schedule interviews** when they're truly prepared
5. **Approach opportunities with confidence**, not just hope

### The Core Philosophy

> **"Every interview is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."**

Job seekers don't get second chances. AGERE ensures they walk into interviews KNOWING they're ready, not just hoping they are.
